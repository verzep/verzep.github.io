When dealing with dynamical systems, one usually faces the problem of partially-observed data.
The engineering literature deals a lot with partially-observed linear dynamical systems, but do we have any hope to make predictions when our system is nonlinear?
To answer this question, we will have to discuss one of the most amazing results in this context: Takens's theorem, which actually allow us to give a positive answer to this question.

In this post, I'll quickly discuss this fundamental theorem and show how we can use it to predict dynamical systems, providing some coding examples in `Python` (using also `scikit-learn` and `Pytorch`) to guide you through it.

## Stating the Problem

Let us consider a (possibly nonlinear) dynamical system, which we write of the form:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:takens_source}
  s_{t} =  g(s_{t-1}) 
\end{equation}

For example, we can use the Lorenz system as in the previous example.

```python

# Define the Lorenz system of differential equations
def lorenz(t, y, sigma, rho, beta):
    dydt = [sigma * (y[1] - y[0]),
            y[0] * (rho - y[2]) - y[1],
            y[0] * y[1] - beta * y[2]]
    return dydt

# Set the parameters
sigma = 10.0
rho = 28.0
beta = 8.0 / 3.0

# Set the initial conditions
initial_conditions = [1.0, 0.0, 20.0]

# Set the time span for integration
t_span = (0, 100)
t_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 12000)

# Solve the system of differential equations
sol = solve_ivp(lorenz, t_span, initial_conditions, args=(sigma, rho, beta), t_eval=t_eval)
```
        
You may argue that the Lorenz System is continuous-time dynamical system, but as discussed [here](https://verzep.github.io/Dynamical-Systems/) one can always construct a discrete-time dynamical system starting from that:
in fact, everytime you measure a system, you'll always deal with discrete observations in time.
Let's now plot one orbit and recognize the famous attractor.

## Observables
Usually things get even more complicated when dealing with real systems.
For example, in many applications it happens that we do not have access to the full state of the system, but only to an observation of its state.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:takens_observable}
    u_{t}= h(s_{t})
\end{equation}
