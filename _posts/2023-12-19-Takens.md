When dealing with dynamical systems, one usually faces the problem of partially-observed data.
The engineering literature deals a lot with partially-observed linear dynamical systems, but do we have any hope to make predictions when our system is nonlinear?
To answer this question, we will have to discuss one of the most amazing results in this context: Takens's theorem, which actually allow us to give a positive answer to this question.

In this post, I'll quickly discuss this fundamental theorem and show how we can use it to predict dynamical systems, providing some coding examples in `Python` (using also `scikit-learn` and `Pytorch`) to guide you through it.
