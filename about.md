### Pietro Verzelli
I received my B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Bologna in 2015 and my M.Sc. in Physics of Complex System from the University of Turin in 2017. Currently I am a Ph.D. student with the Faculty of Informatics at Universit√† della Svizzera italiana, in Lugano (Switzerland). 
My research focuses on the relationships between dynamical systems and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on recurrent neural networks and reservoir computing.
I mainly deal with the pointless aspects of important things.
