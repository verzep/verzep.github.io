### Pietro Verzelli


![]({{ site.url }}/images/propic.jpg)

I am a postdoc researcher in [Tatjana Tchumatchenko's Lab](http://www.tchumatchenko.de/), working on computational and theoretical neuroscience. My research focuses on the relationship between neural activity and behaviors.

I received my B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Bologna in 2015 and my M.Sc. in Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Turin in 2017. In my master's thesis, I developed statistical tools to study neural activity, supervised by [Prof. Laura Sacerdote](http://www.laurasacerdote.it/index.html).
I obtained my PhD at [IDSIA](https://www.idsia.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Cesare Alippi](https://gmlg.ch/index.html) and [Prof. Lorenzo Livi](https://sites.google.com/site/lorenzlivi/), with a thesis on machine learning for dynamical systems. 

I mainly deal with the pointless aspects of important things.
